Here are my own dotfiles.

Some steps are not automated (yet).

- Firefox
  - Authenticate to Firefox Sync
  - Configure the toolbar
  - Install [GithubDark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/Github-Dark)
- iTerm 2
  - Disable confirmation when quitting
  - Set the correct theme
  - Emulate US keyboards (so `Cmd` + `number` switches tab)
- Karabiner
  - Create a new `goku` profile
  - Hide the menu bar icon (from the `misc` settings)
- Spectacle
  - Launch at startup
  - Set the application to run in background (to remove the icon from the menu bar)
